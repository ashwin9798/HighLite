00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.730
(Drum

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.960
roll)

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:40.140
Hi Doug, how can I

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.610
help?
(Applause).

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.690
Thank you for being here. We
are being joined by many people

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.270
at global launch events around
the world so welcome to all of

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.040
them as well. We also have a
Live Stream so I lot of folks

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.860
are joining on the Live Stream
including Dinesh, I'm told. So

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.030
welcome everyone. This space
used to be a power station for

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.300
a chocolate factory in the
1900's. So we have transformed

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.470
it pretty well, but I'm glad we
have a historic setting as we

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.030
talk about what we are building
for the future. At I/O earlier

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.580
this year, we talk the about
our vision for that

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.710
future. We
are at a seminal moment in

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.740
computing. If you step back
and think about it, computing

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.930
has had big shifts every ten
years

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:38.070
or so. It all started in
the 80s. It was the first

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.030
time computing touched the
lives of many people and

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.720
revolutionized the way they
work. Roughly a decade later,

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.710
in the mid 90s, the Web
arrived. It is arguably the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.401
biggest platform shift we have
seen in our lifetimes. It

00:01:53.401 --> 00:01:57.570
brought the Internet to many
more people, radically changed

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.290
industries. Fund
Fundamentally changes few

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.500
people interjackets and connect

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.670
with each other. In the mid
2000s with the advent of

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.730
smartphone we had the mobile
revolution. That brought

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.910
computing to probably now
around half the world's

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.340
population. And it's
profoundly changing people's

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.750
lives. The shift continues.
When I look ahead at where

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.350
computing is headed. It's
clear to me that we are

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.270
evolving from a mobile first to
an AI first world. What do I

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.370
mean by that? In this world,
computing will be universally

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:44.120
available. It will be there
everywhere in the context of a

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.900
be able to interact with
everybody naturally and s

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.470
eamlessly than ever before.
And above all else, it will be

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.090
intelligent. It will help
users in more meaningful ways.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.260
At Google, we are very, very
excited about the shift and we

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.620
have been working for a long
time towards this shift. At

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.069
the heart of these efforts is
our goal to build a Google

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:16.120
Assistant. We spoke about the

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:23.489
the asissant the
Google IO this

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:29.879
year. The asis stant will be
universal, it will be available

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:35.520
when the users need it to help
them. And our goal is to build

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.190
a personal Google for each and
every user. Just like we bhilt

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.900
a Google -- built a Google for
everyone, we want to build each

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.550
user his or her own individual
Google. To capture our vision

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.510
for what the Google Assistant
is. We put together a short

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.260
video. Let's take a look.
When we started, we made this

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.569
for everyone so that everyone
could find everything they need

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.239
among the millions of things in
the world. Today it seems

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.860
like sometimes it's easy to
feel like you need a little

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.780
help with the stuff just in
your own world, photos, phone,

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.060
videos, calendars, friends,
trips, reservations, so on, so

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.500
on. Wouldn't it be nice if you

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:25.690
had help with that? That's why
we are building the Google

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.040
Assistant. Hi, Amy, how can I
help? You ask it what you n

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.060
eed. Okay, Google, what do I
have to do today? And your

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.940
assistant understands and helps
you out. You can carry on a

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.190
conversation how long will it
take to get to downtown Chicago

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:45.169
from home. What restaurants
are there. Book a table at C

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.960
ortino restaurant. And the
assistant is there for you, so

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.500
if you are on the road you can
ask it where to fill up. And

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.410
if you are at home you can ask
it to play music or if you are

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.460
in a chat with a friend, it can
show you what is playing

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.090
tonight. It's your own
personal Google. Naturally

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.651
anything you share with it is
safe and secure. The more you

00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:09.390
use your Google Assistant, the
more useful it becomes.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.690
Remember my bike come combo is
326.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:21.840
Got it? Soon you will be able
to access it. Today we are

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.691
making this just for you.
Hi, how can I help? Meet your

00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:32.090
Google Assistant.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.310
early vision for how we want to
build the Google assistant. We

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.800
are just getting started
3R50EU7B but in many ways we

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.060
have been working hard at this
problem ever since Google was

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.300
founded 18 years ago. We have
invested in deep areas of

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:52.150
computer science. Today our
Knowledge Graph has more than

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:57.211
70 billion facts about people,
places and things and we can

00:05:57.211 --> 00:06:00.120
answer questions based on that.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.190
Our natural language processing

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.050
is what helps us make Google
truly conversational with our

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:11.710
users. And we have built state
of the art machine translation,

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.580
image recognition and voice
recognition systems. And each

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.381
of these areas is being turbo
charged by the progress we are

00:06:19.381 --> 00:06:24.360
seeing with Machine Learning
and AI. A few months ago, we

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.240
captured the world's attention
when Deep Minds Alpha Go won

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:35.730
the world championship. It
showed the external world a

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:40.120
moment for AI has arrived but
for us, the progress has been

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:45.120
con continuous and the strides
are huge. In fact, in the

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.800
three months since Alpha Go
played that game, we have had

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.630
meaningful launches and how
Machine Learning is impacting

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:57.560
the products we build. Let me
talk about three examples, all

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.490
of which we have talked about
in the past three months since

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:05.251
the Alpha Go moment. First,
image captioning. Image

00:07:05.251 --> 00:07:09.040
captioning is now computers try
to make sense of images they

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.330
look at. We first launched our
Machine Learning system in

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.610
2014. It was state of the art
system and our quality was

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:23.099
around just over 89%. Our
newer Machine Learning systems

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:29.110
now, the quality is close to
94%. 4% may not seem like much

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.620
to you, but first, it's really
hard to increase quality at

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.650
these levels because we are
trying to approach human level

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:42.199
accuracy. And, second, every
single percentage point

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:45.400
translates into meaningful
difference for our users. So,

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.800
for example, if you take a look
at the picture behind me, about

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.490
two years ago, we used to
understand this picture as a

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:53.800
train is sitting on the tracks.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.680
Now, we understand the colors
so we describe is as a blue and

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.639
yellow train is traveling down
the tracks. Or if you look at

00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:06.521
this picture, two years ago we
understood it as a brown bear

00:08:06.521 --> 00:08:10.790
is swimming in the water. Now,
we can count, the computing

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:14.849
systems can count, so we
understand this is two brown

00:08:14.849 --> 00:08:18.979
bears sitting on top of rocks.
Advances like this is what h

00:08:18.979 --> 00:08:22.389
elps us when you are in Google
Photos find the exact pictures

00:08:22.389 --> 00:08:26.849
you are looking for and be a
better assistant to you.

00:08:26.849 --> 00:08:30.170
Another example, machine
translation. We have been d

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:34.089
oing machine translation for a
while. And historically our

00:08:34.089 --> 00:08:38.600
systems are statistics based
and we translate at a phrase by

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:43.120
phrase level. So we translate
individual phrases and combine

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.520
them to form translation. If
you look at this Chinese to

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:50.010
English translation, you can
see it makes sense, but it's

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:54.890
not quite the way humans would
translate it. Just recently we

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:58.540
announced our first end-to-end
self-learning, deep learning

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:02.410
machine translation systems.
Rather than working at phrase

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:06.890
level, they take entire
sentences and model sentences

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:10.640
as outputs. That's what you
see in the middle and you can

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:15.040
see it as approaching human
level translation. You can

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.070
look at this quantitatively,
and we have a beta to measure

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:21.000
these things quantitatively, if
you look at this previous

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
phrase based system it was
quite far from the human system

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.520
and we closed a significant gap
with our new Machine Learning

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.000
systems. In fact, the progress
for Chinese to English is so

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.100
significant, last week we r
olled it out in production and

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.620
so today if you pick the Google
translate mobile app and try

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:44.000
faux translate from Chinese to
English, you are using our

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.980
newer Machine Learning systems
and the progress has been

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.550
amazing. We literally
translated billions of queries

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:54.740
over the coming year. This is
what will help us if a user in

00:09:54.740 --> 00:10:00.130
Indonesia is ew using Google
Assistant, even if it doesn't

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:04.130
exist in their local language,
translate it on the fly and get

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:10.080
it to them. Another example,
text to speech, text to speech

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.820
is what we call when computers
read something aloud back to

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:19.740
you. So when you ask Google a
question. Who is the Prime

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:23.740
Minister of Canada? We
understand the text and try to

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.820
make it as natural as possible
for

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:35.070
you. So the way we do
today we get a speaker into our

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:39.600
recording studios, we record
them for thousands of hours.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.160
We make them say short phrases
and then combine them to be as

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.200
natural sounding as possible.
Again, deep learning is showing

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:52.000
the way. Deep Mind just
published a paper with a new

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.600
technology called Wavenet.
It's a deep learning model

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.200
where rather than modeling
phrases they actually model the

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.430
underlying raw audio waves to
generate a much more natural

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:06.980
sound. You can again see
Wavenet model is getting much

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:10.920
closer to human speech. To me
the reason this gets exciting

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.640
is today all we can do is a
single voice for the the

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:20.140
assistant for all context.
Doing this is what will enable

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:27.240
us to have multiple voices,
multiple personalities, get the

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:31.970
between German and Swiss German
and capture emotions when

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:36.570
speaking to you. This is key
to our vision for building an

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:41.760
individual Google for each u
ser, and more importantly, the

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.170
assistant will continuously get
better as we make progress with

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:46.170
Machine Learning and

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:50.040
AI. It is
early days but we have

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.860
committed to this vision and we
are going to work on it for a

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:57.980
long time. It's equally
important to get the assistant

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:02.320
in the hands of our users. And
that's what today is before.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.130
In fact, we started doing it
about two weeks ago with our

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:10.300
new messaging app, Google Allo
in which they can invoke the

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:16.860
Google in conversations. The
early reception has been great.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:22.050
very naturally, asking us
questions we expected like tell

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:26.070
me a joke, but also questions
we didn't expect like what is

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:30.089
the meaning of life. So it's
Orlandoly days, but the

00:12:30.089 --> 00:12:33.350
assistant continuously learns
from this experience and keeps

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:37.560
getting better. If you
remember the our vision for

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.600
Google Assistant is to be
universal, to be everywhere the

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.600
user need it's to be, which is
why today we are going to bring

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.720
the assistant to two more
surfaces, one in the context of

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:53.660
the phone which you always
carry with you, and one in the

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:58.220
context of your home. To talk
about the Google Assistant in

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:02.730
new hardware products, let me
invite Rick, the head of the

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:10.240
newly formed harmware group.
(Applause).

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:19.130
an honor to be here ted
representing the hard work of

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:20.640
so many of my colleagues.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:24.839
I've
been doing hardware for a

00:13:24.839 --> 00:13:29.610
smile like a kid every time I
unbox a new gadget.

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:31.089
Since I
joined Google, one of the

00:13:31.089 --> 00:13:34.470
questions I get asked the most
is why should we build

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:37.510
hardware?
We often joke that building

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:40.040
hardware is, well, hard.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.290
But
people have strong, emotional

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:44.850
connections to the products
they

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:48.149
rely on everyday. They are an
important part of our users'

00:13:48.149 --> 00:13:49.149
lives.

00:13:49.149 --> 00:13:51.019
B u t
the rise of volume and

00:13:51.019 --> 00:13:56.220
complexity of all of the
information makes it so that

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:59.850
this is the right time to be
focused on hardware and

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:01.660
Let's
think about that for asoftware.

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:03.790
Let's think about that for a
moment.

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:06.589
At the peak of film
photography,

00:14:06.589 --> 00:14:11.710
80B photos were captured
annually. Last year alone,

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:13.510
thanks to smartphones,

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:19.740
One trillion photos were taken.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:24.160
similarly complex. 328 billion
items were delivered by the

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:30.339
post office last year. That's
compared to 50 trillion emails

00:14:30.339 --> 00:14:31.339
and mobile

00:14:31.339 --> 00:14:35.230
messages and today
people want more than a

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:38.450
thousand songs in their pocket.

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:42.820
What they want is the entire
world's music collection with

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.839
them at all times. These
informational changes mean the

00:14:46.839 --> 00:14:52.250
technology needs to be smart,
and just work for you. This is

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.380
why we believe the next big
innovation is going to take

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:59.830
place at the intersection of
hardware and software with AI

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:03.890
at the center. That's where we
have the biggest opportunity to

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:07.860
bring people the very best of
Google as we intended it.

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:11.330
Building hardware and software
together let's us take full

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:15.760
advantage of capabilities like
the Google asis apt --

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:20.110
assistant. It lets us harness
years of expertise we have

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:25.050
built up in Machine Learning
and AI to deliver the simple,

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:30.161
smart and fast experiences that
our users expect from us. It

00:15:30.161 --> 00:15:32.940
allows Google to be helpful to
people no matter where they

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:38.561
need us no matter what the
context or form factor. As you

00:15:38.561 --> 00:15:41.970
will see today, we are building
hardware with the Google

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:45.220
assistant at its core so you
can get things done without

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:49.170
worrying about the underlying
technology. Our devices just

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:53.210
work for you, whether you are
at home, with family, commuting

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:57.680
to work, out for a jog or
spending time with friends.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:01.500
This is something that Google
has always stood for. Hardware

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:05.509
isn't a new area for Google,
but now we are taking steps to

00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:08.670
showcase the very best of
Google Google across a family

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:13.339
of devices designed and built
by us. This is a natural step

00:16:13.339 --> 00:16:16.990
and we are in it for the long
run. You are going to hear

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:19.790
much more from our team in the
coming months and years to

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:21.560
come, and we have lots in store

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:27.470
for you today. So let's get
started, first with

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:32.650
phones.
Phones are the most important

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:37.170
device we own. They rarely
leave our side. They are

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:44.370
literally most people's
lifeline to the Internet and to

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:49.280
excited to introduce you to a
new phone made by Google. We

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:55.450
call it Pixel.
(

00:16:55.450 --> 00:17:02.440
Applause).
For those of you who followed

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:06.500
Google for a while, that name
might sound familiar to you.

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:12.139
For us, it's always represented
the best hardware and software

00:17:12.139 --> 00:17:16.400
designed and built by Google.
Let me tell you a little bit

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.720
more about

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:19.960
We designed
everything aboutPixel.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:24.130
Pixel, from the industrial
design to the user experience.

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:25.280
Everything is simple and easy
to

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:29.730
use -- something Google has
always stood for. I really love

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:33.540
how this phone looks and feels.

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:36.760
iconic element that gives Pixel

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:41.140
personality and character. The
polished aluminum case gives

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.260
the
phone a distinct look, and

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.419
there's a subtle wedge from the
top to the bottom that keeps it

00:17:46.419 --> 00:17:50.160
thin where your hand most
naturally grips it.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:55.660
And there's
no unsightly camera bump.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:57.679
And
while Pixel is beautiful, what

00:17:57.679 --> 00:18:01.120
really makes it come to life is
how the hardware and software

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.160
work together.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.220
It's the perfect
example of the best of Google

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:14.150
smarts with a simple user
experience.

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:15.870
you about 5 things

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:20.250
F irst, we're
excited to announce that Pixel

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:23.860
is the first phone with the
Google Google Assistant built

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:30.970
in. Second, is pixel's
terrific photography

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:36.740
experience. Third, is how we
use Google Cloud so you never

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:42.720
run out of space for those
great photos. Fourth, is how

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.880
we let people talk to each
other much more easily no

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:51.410
matter what operating system or
device they use. And finally,

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:57.370
is now Pixel is made for mobile
Virtual Reality. To tell you

00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:01.220
more about Pixel, I'd like to
invite my colleague, Brian, to

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:02.220
the

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.940
stage.
(

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:13.020
Applause).
Hi, I'm Brian, I lead the

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.549
software product management
team There have been so many

00:19:15.549 --> 00:19:16.549
people
forePixel.

00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:17.549
There have been so many people

00:19:17.549 --> 00:19:19.559
who worked so hard on this, so
I

00:19:19.559 --> 00:19:20.559
feel lucky to be the one to
show

00:19:20.559 --> 00:19:23.240
you what we've built.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.900
This phone
was designed inside and out to

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.419
be simple and smart, and I
think

00:19:28.419 --> 00:19:34.030
you'll notice that right from
the start with the homescreen.

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:37.960
thing you'll see is the new
Pixel launcher, with round

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:42.150
icons, access to all your apps
just a swipe away, and a clean,

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:43.770
polished look.

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:47.710
And like Rick
said, Pixel is the first phone

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:51.350
with the Google Assistant built
in. Having the Assistant with

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:56.060
you, all through your day makes
so many tasks incredibly easy.

00:19:56.060 --> 00:20:01.290
hotword, and the Assistant
jumps

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:06.200
into action. Whether you're on
your home screen or in any app,

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.280
you can always ask your
Assistant for information or

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.280
for
help with tasks.

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:14.380
Let me show you
how it works. Getting ready for

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.710
today's
launch, I've been spending a

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:18.520
bit
more time at the office than

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:22.010
usual, so I'm looking to plan
something with family. And fall

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:25.120
is such a great time in the Bay
Area, I can get some ideas for

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.640
this weekend with a press of
the

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:30.640
home button and

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.250
Show me my
photos from last October.

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:39.740
T a k e
a look at these pictures from

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.710
command my assistant found just

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:44.831
the right picks from my Google
Photos collection, and it

00:20:44.831 --> 00:20:47.830
doesn't just work for dates,
you can sure itch for people,

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:48.830
places and things

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:50.730
That concert
at the Greektoo.

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:54.770
That concert at the Greek
Theatre was great. Let's see

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:56.880
what shows are coming up.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.580
"Show
me upcoming events at the Greek

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:00.580
Theater in Berkeley"

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:07.990
C h a n ce
the rapper and Lauren

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:12.789
Let's
talk about what justhill.

00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:17.809
Let's talk about what just
happened there. Not only did my

00:21:17.809 --> 00:21:19.500
I
asked about, it was able to

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.860
serve up really useful
information thanks to Google's

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:23.400
Knowledge Graph.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.210
Ok, looks like
the Lumineers are playing. I

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:28.590
like their music, but I haven't
heard

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:32.520
their latest stuff. "Play me a
song by the Lumineers"

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:36.909
P l a y
ing

00:21:36.909 --> 00:21:38.171
The Assistant knows I like to
music.

00:21:38.171 --> 00:21:39.870
The Assistant knows I like to
listen to music on YouTube, so

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:44.000
that's the app it opens.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000
(

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:52.679
Yup,
this seems like it wouldM usic)

00:21:52.679 --> 00:21:59.030
Yup, this seems like it would
be a fun concert. Let's see if

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:00.030
my wife will even

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:04.280
r emembers who
I am after being three weeks of

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:12.451
Lisa. Sure what's
the message. Want to go see

00:22:12.451 --> 00:22:17.840
the Lumineers in Berkeley on
Friday? Got it. Do you want

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:26.070
to send it or change it? Send
it. Okay. Message

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:27.070
Now I just
sent that messagesent.

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:28.750
Now I just sent that message
as an SMS, but the Assistant

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:29.970
also works with other messaging

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:31.760
apps like Whatsapp and Viber.
Or

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.241
I could have asked the
Assistant

00:22:33.241 --> 00:22:37.850
to call Lisa instead. I t l
ooks like she responded.

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:40.720
Thankfully she wants to go and
she is recommending we get

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:44.520
dinner at Marzano first. I
haven't been there before so

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:48.919
let's try to get more info.
Now, watch this. The assistant

00:22:48.919 --> 00:22:52.770
can also help get information
based on what's on my screen.

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:56.809
So I will do the same long
press gesture on home and swipe

00:22:56.809 --> 00:23:04.380
get contextually relevant
information. Here is what just

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:06.720
happened the assistant
recognized the restaurant in

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.179
Lisa's text mess annual and
assembled this useful

00:23:09.179 --> 00:23:12.620
information into a single card
from the apps I have installed

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:17.260
on the phone. I didn't have to
say or type a single word.

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.470
Let's get more information from
Google Maps.

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:23.059
There is the location. You can

00:23:23.059 --> 00:23:29.370
wipe up, check out p ictures.
Okay. It looks pretty good.

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:33.780
Let's see if it's close enough
to the concert. How far is it

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:34.780
from the Greek Theatre in

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:40.600
Berkeley? If you drive Marzano

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.960
is 6.4 miles away from the
Greek Again, the Assistant

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:44.960
understood
Theatre.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.340
Again, the Assistant understood

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:50.530
the context of my screen to
answer my question. A quick

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:52.241
drive, that will totally work.
Let's get reservations.

00:23:52.241 --> 00:23:56.580
M a k e
a reservation at Marzano for

00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:01.919
Friday. Sure, let's make a
reservation at Marzano with

00:24:01.919 --> 00:24:07.980
open table. How many people in
your party. Two people. And

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.641
what time do you want to
reserve? 6:00 p.

00:24:10.641 --> 00:24:16.370
m. Okay. I
have completed the reservation,

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:19.779
so you are all set. Look for
an email confirmation from open

00:24:19.779 --> 00:24:21.279
table with all of the

00:24:21.279 --> 00:24:23.270
details. (
Cheers and applause) So that's

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:24.270
just a glimpse how.
So that's just a glimpse how

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:30.970
the Google Assistant works. It

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:35.600
can help with the big things
like weekend plans, but it's

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.750
also great for all the small
things throughout your day,

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:38.660
like
getting around, finding

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:40.830
information right in the
moment,

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:42.770
setting reminders for yourself
and much more.

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:45.950
T h e a s s i s t
ant is incredibly useful when

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:48.049
its built right into your phone

00:24:48.049 --> 00:24:50.100
and I will show you how it
works in other contexts later

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:54.900
too. The Google Assistant on
Pixel is a great example of how

00:24:54.900 --> 00:25:02.991
together beautifully. Another
is the camera. There's

00:25:02.991 --> 00:25:05.030
actually an industry group DXLR

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:11.290
that rates dSLR and mart phone
cameras on the market. These

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:14.080
guys are obsessed with cameras,

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:18.120
lenses and image quality.
We're proud to report that

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:22.210
Pixel received a rating of 89.

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:27.200
That's the highest rating ever
for a smartphone.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.200
(

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:33.870
Let me put that score into
Applause).

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:36.870
context.
This isn't only the best camera

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:41.710
the best smartphone camera
anyone has ever made.

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:44.270
So how did
we achieve this? Our teams of

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:47.480
photography gurus and image
processing experts have spent

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.789
the last year designing and
tirelessly

00:25:49.789 --> 00:25:57.059
optimizing our entire camera
stack.

00:25:57.059 --> 00:26:03.429
camera, featuring an f/2.0

00:26:03.429 --> 00:26:04.789
pixels to capture significantly

00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:08.790
more light than other cameras.

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:12.919
excellent.
Our amazing camera team has

00:26:12.919 --> 00:26:15.700
written some incredible
on-device software algorithms

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:18.059
that do things you can't do
with

00:26:18.059 --> 00:26:20.000
great hardware alone.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.900
For instance:
Smart Burst is a feature that

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:25.500
lets you capture just the right
moment.

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:27.669
By holding down the shutter
button, you can capture a

00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:30.650
continuous stream of pictures
and let Google intelligence

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:34.240
select the sharpest, clearest
photo, of just the right

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:39.750
moment.

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:44.000
built to work in any light, so
you get clear, vivid pictures

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.330
even in challenging conditions.

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:48.540
A l l
the pictures you see here were

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:52.210
use aPixel.
Traditional cameras use a

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:56.409
single long exposure in low
light, but HDR Plus splits that

00:26:56.409 --> 00:27:01.370
exposures, aligning them
algorithmically, and then

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:03.460
combining each pixel.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:05.950
This
technique reduces noise,

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:09.390
minimizes blur, and gives you
extended dynamic range, as in

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:11.320
this example preserving both
the

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.840
dimly lit people in the
foreground and the beautiful

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.050
sunset behind them.

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:25.200
HDR Plus
clearly improves image quality.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.400
there is zero shutter lag. This

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:31.480
is BIG deal, and it processes
images twice as fast as before

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:37.460
so you can keep shooting, rapid
fire.

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.240
great photos is the speed of
the

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.230
camera app.

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:43.470
We know this is really
important -- you don't want to

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:46.600
miss the moment while your
camera gets itself ready. And

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.460
I'm really proud to say that
our

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:52.460
camera has a shorter capture
time than any of the smartphone

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:55.419
cameras we've tested!! Which
makes action shots like this

00:27:55.419 --> 00:27:58.169
possible.

00:27:58.169 --> 00:28:05.480
feature, our incredible video
stabilization.

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:09.600
smooth even if you're not. Let
me tell you how this video was

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.600
captured. We mounted two

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.100
C a m e
ras side by side. Hit record

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:17.169
on each and started walking.
The one on the left has video

00:28:17.169 --> 00:28:20.480
stabilization turned off, the
one on the right has it on.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.909
Just look at the This works by
sampling thedifference!

00:28:23.909 --> 00:28:27.090
This works by sampling the
gyroscope 200 times/second to

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:30.570
figure out exactly how the
camera is moving, even

00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:33.049
accounting for the rolling
shutter and instantaneously

00:28:33.049 --> 00:28:35.350
compensating in each part of
the

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:38.700
image to avoid the "jello"
effect you see with other forms

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:44.029
stabilization.

00:28:44.029 --> 00:28:47.980
Google Photos built in. Once
you've captured the moment with

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:52.010
Pixel's powerful camera, Google
Photos helps you store,

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:55.610
organize, and share all your

00:28:55.610 --> 00:29:00.140
how goofy they may be. We think
people are going to use this

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:04.750
camera a lot. So as a special
bonus for Pixel owners, we're

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:07.230
including free unlimited
storage

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:10.970
for photos and videos, at
original quality.

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:13.460
That's all
your photos and videos at full

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:17.110
resolution
including the rich 4K videos

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:19.370
you
can take with this phone. So,

00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:21.299
with Pixel, you'll never run
out

00:29:21.299 --> 00:29:26.580
of space for your memories.( C
heers and

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:27.580
applause) And you can
say goodbye to.

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.010
And you can say goodbye to
those painful "Storage Full"

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:32.570
pop-ups.S o
that was a quick intro to the

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:37.490
Google Assistant on Pixel and
our new best in class ramra

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:38.490
integrated with Google

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:39.760
Now I'd
like to invite SabrinaPhotos.

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.010
Now I'd like to invite Sabrina

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:43.929
up to share some more great
features of Pixel, but before

00:29:43.929 --> 00:29:52.200
that let's watch this new spot
from our upcoming campaign.

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:53.200
(

00:29:53.200 --> 00:30:17.570
M u s i c)

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:18.570
.
(

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:24.309
Hi, I'm Sabrina, and I work
Applause).

00:30:24.309 --> 00:30:25.679
with Brian on the Pixel Product

00:30:25.679 --> 00:30:30.100
Management team. At Google,
we've always taken pride in

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:34.100
creating things that are both
smart and simple. So, we've

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:36.500
thought a lot about all the
different features that make

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.990
your phone work for you. I
can't

00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:40.650
wait to share just a few of
them

00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:42.220
with you.

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:44.059
First, let's talk about

00:30:44.059 --> 00:30:46.380
Communications.
Whether your friends are on

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:50.020
Android or iOS, Google Duo, our

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:51.720
new video calling app, lets you

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:55.529
jump into a call with just a
single tap. And it comes

00:30:55.529 --> 00:30:58.060
pre-installed on Pixel.

00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:59.649
My
favorite feature in Duo is

00:30:59.649 --> 00:31:02.580
called knock knock. It shows
you

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:05.690
a live video stream of the
person calling you before you

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:09.770
pick up, so you can see who's
calling and even what they're

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:12.740
doing.

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:16.520
Now,
let's talk about something I

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.370
know you all really care about

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:20.650
-- the battery.

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:23.240
We've spent a
lot of time optimizing Pixel to

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:26.299
be smart about improving
battery life.

00:31:26.299 --> 00:31:27.990
We made sure you can easily get

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:31.240
through your day. But, for the
times when you need a quick

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.630
charge -- like when you're
about

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:35.529
to head out to dinner and you
realize you have literally no

00:31:35.529 --> 00:31:39.570
power left on your phone --
Pixel can get you up to 7 hours

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:43.870
of power, in just 15 mins of
charging.

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:49.100
of course, Pixel ships with the
newest Android operating

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:51.799
system,
7.1 Nougat. Pixel users will

00:31:51.799 --> 00:31:54.019
get
system and security updates as

00:31:54.019 --> 00:31:55.830
soon as they're available,
directly

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:57.640
from Google.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.309
We've also made the update
process easier. When a new

00:32:00.309 --> 00:32:02.320
update is available, it will be

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.649
downloaded and installed in the
background.

00:32:04.649 --> 00:32:08.789
That means, the next time you
restart the phone, you'll

00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:11.899
instantly be using the new
version. We just take care of

00:32:11.899 --> 00:32:14.010
it
for you.

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:16.510
Gone are the days of
staring at a progress bar while

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:21.299
waiting
for an update to install.

00:32:21.299 --> 00:32:22.769
We
also really want to make sure

00:32:22.769 --> 00:32:25.820
you feel supported when you're
using your Pixel. So, we've

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:31.640
built 24/7 live customer care
right into the phone. You can

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:35.250
reach a Google support agent
over phone or chat.

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:36.789
And to make
it easier for them to

00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:40.640
understand
and help solve the problem,

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.380
we've added a screenshare
option

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:47.510
so you can let the agent see
what you see.

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:49.649
Now that we've
given you all these reasons to

00:32:49.649 --> 00:32:51.830
switch to Pixel, we've also
made

00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:53.850
it super simple to transfer
over

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:55.640
everything that you really care
about.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.080
Y e s
k now historically it's been

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:02.149
hard to switch from one OS to
another so we built a new tool

00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:07.380
to let you quickly and easily
transfer contacts, p hotos,

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:11.350
videos, music, texts, calendar
appointments and your

00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:14.429
iMessages.
We even put a Quick Switch

00:33:14.429 --> 00:33:18.010
Adapter in every box.

00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:19.940
We're also
excited to introduce a brand

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:21.630
new
range of cases and accessories

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:24.900
for Pixel. These include a new
Artworks

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:28.100
collection of our Live Cases
with custom designs from top

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:31.289
artists such as FAILE, and
photographers, like Gray Malin

00:33:31.289 --> 00:33:33.700
and Chris Hadfield.

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:38.710
Finally,
Pixel comes in two sizes: A 5"

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:42.019
and a 5.5" display All the
great

00:33:42.019 --> 00:33:43.019
features you've

00:33:43.019 --> 00:33:45.660
heard about
today work on both.

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:50.080
And, both of
these sizes come with all of

00:33:50.080 --> 00:34:03.429
these amazing hardware specs.

00:34:03.429 --> 00:34:06.919
Quite
Black. Very Silver.

00:34:06.919 --> 00:34:12.419
And a
limited edition, Really Blue.

00:34:12.419 --> 00:34:13.419
(

00:34:13.419 --> 00:34:16.780
So, let's recap the
highlights.

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:17.780
Applause).

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:18.950
So, let's recap the highlights.

00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:21.330
ship
with the Google Assistant built

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:25.569
in.
It has the best smartphone

00:34:25.569 --> 00:34:27.649
includes
unlimited storage for all your

00:34:27.649 --> 00:34:34.179
photos and videos. It comes
with Duo pre-installed.

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:36.340
be
Daydream VR ready. You'll be

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:38.360
hearing more about VR shortly.

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:42.750
n o w
, where can you get this stuff?

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:45.880
Here in the U.S. we're teaming
up exclusively with Verizon to

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:48.030
bring people el to the market.

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:49.379
We're proud to work with them

00:34:49.379 --> 00:34:50.710
We're proud to work with them
to put Pixel in the hands of as

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:52.179
We're
also excited to be working with

00:34:52.179 --> 00:34:54.850
many international partners to
bring Pixel to the world

00:34:54.850 --> 00:35:00.290
Additionally, Pixel will be
available, unlocked, on the

00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:05.990
Google Store. And for you
Project Fi fans out there,

00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:07.320
you'll be happy to know

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.099
that
Pixel is the latest device to

00:35:09.099 --> 00:35:14.040
work on the Project Fi network.

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:20.740
$27/month on the Google Store
here in the US.

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:23.589
It's available
for pre-order starting today in

00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:27.820
the US, Australia, Canada,
Germany and the UK. And in

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:31.070
India
starting on October 13.

00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:33.960
So
that's the new Pixel, the first

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:38.010
phone made by Google, inside
and out.

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:42.349
to
you about VR. But, before that,

00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:53.109
here's a recap of all the
newness of Pixel.

00:35:53.109 --> 00:36:09.510
( M usic)
(

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:59.200
Applause).
Hi, how can I help?

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:00.200
(

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:22.579
Applause). Hi I'm Clay. I lead
the virtual

00:37:22.579 --> 00:37:27.440
working on.
Just to say it: we love VR. For

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:30.520
it's not just another screen.
VR

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.790
is something we believe is
going

00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:35.480
to be important, because unlike
anything we've seen before, it

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:38.990
can make you feel like you're
somewhere else. It's

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:40.490
transporting.
With VR, you can put on some

00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:45.089
goggles and feel, viscerally,
like you're somewhere else.

00:37:45.089 --> 00:37:46.850
It's
richer, and far more immersive,

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:54.140
and it will impact how we
explore, work, play, and learn.

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:57.720
immersion takes some powerful
technology, and my team's goal

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:04.350
is to make that technology
simpler, friendlier, and more

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:06.170
accessible.

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:07.710
platform for high quality
mobile

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:11.310
virtual reality. Daydream ties
together a bunch of things you

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:16.700
need for great VR. Software
optimizations.

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:22.070
experiences. All of this is in
service of creating a healthy

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:23.920
VR
ecosystem with our partners,

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:26.170
and
with developers." Today, we've

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:27.780
got news in all of these areas.

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:30.340
Let's start with phones.

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:31.820
You
just heard about the new Pixel

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:35.600
phones. They're great phones.
And, as Sabrina said, we've

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.070
made
them great for VR, too. We've

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:41.400
tuned everything from their
sensors to their displays. And

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:44.741
the Pixel phones are the first
which are Daydream-ready, as we

00:38:44.741 --> 00:38:45.741
call it.

00:38:45.741 --> 00:38:48.530
Now, of course, you
need some extra hardware to

00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:54.190
unlock its VR capabilities.
Let's talk about the headset.

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:55.800
The headset is important to get

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:59.320
right. I mean, it's something
that you wear. On your head!

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:03.000
But, when we looked out there,
we saw some problems. We saw

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.349
issues with comfort.

00:39:04.349 --> 00:39:06.070
We saw
stuff that's pretty hard to

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:08.119
use,
pretty complicated. And,

00:39:08.119 --> 00:39:11.490
everything just kind of looked
the same. We looked at all

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:13.170
this,
and we had some ideas. And, we

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:17.810
have a bit of a different take
on the VR headset.

00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:20.450
I'd like to
introduce you to... Daydream

00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:22.560
View.

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.670
(Applause).

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:30.170
It's the first Daydream-ready

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:33.770
H
ead set. If you are into VR,

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:35.950
I'll just say that all specs
are there. It's a nice field

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:39.829
of view and with Daydream p
hone, low latency and accurate

00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:43.070
head But we didn't just look
at the

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:44.070
tracking.
But we didn't just look at the

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:46.360
details of the design. We
wanted

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:50.270
to make it comfortable, and
really easy to use. And we

00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:54.270
thought about how to make it
your own. First, let's talk

00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:58.570
about
comfort. How it fits, how it

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:00.601
feels.
You'll notice immediately, it

00:40:00.601 --> 00:40:02.660
doesn't quite look like other
VR

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:04.250
headsets. And that's because,
in

00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:07.369
designing it, we weren't
inspired by gadgets. Instead,

00:40:07.369 --> 00:40:08.680
we
looked at what do people

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:14.540
actually wear? We wear stuff
that's soft, and flexible, and

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:16.950
breathable. So we crafted our
headset out of that same

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:18.960
comfortable stuff.

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.589
Fabrics, soft
micro-fiber, and

00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:24.530
other materials
borrowed from clothing and

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:28.560
athletic wear. In fact, we
worked with clothing makers to

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.960
get the design just right. And
the

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:32.609
result is something that's
soft,

00:40:32.609 --> 00:40:36.330
and cozy, and that feels great
to wear. So the materials are

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:39.970
really nice.

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:43.720
lighter than similar devices.
And one other thing. To see

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:48.080
comfortably, some people need
some help. People like… me. So

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:51.420
we made sure that the headset
fits well over eye-glasses.

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:57.150
So, comfort.

00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:59.370
it
easy to use.

00:40:59.370 --> 00:41:02.460
To start, it's
gotta be easy to get into VR.

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:05.140
You don't want to think about
cables, and wires, and lots of

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:06.930
clicky thingies and connectors.

00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:09.849
All that stuff just gets in the
way.

00:41:09.849 --> 00:41:18.160
Really, you just want to pop
your phone in and be in VR. And

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:23.599
works.

00:41:23.599 --> 00:41:26.170
The
headset and phone say hello,

00:41:26.170 --> 00:41:29.190
wirelessly. There's nothing to
connect. And the headset

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:32.040
includes an auto alignment
system that gets everything

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:35.780
just right.
So getting into VR is easy.

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:37.850
We
wanted interacting with it to

00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:40.140
be
easy, too. And that's where the

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:42.660
Daydream controller comes in.

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:45.829
important. Because when you go
someplace, you want to be able

00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:54.280
to do things there! Let's have
a look.

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:59.130
But it's more to it than meets
the eye. Hidden inside are a

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:00.730
bunch of sensors that respond
to

00:42:00.730 --> 00:42:01.730
how you

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:07.160
move. You can point,
swing, and aim. It's so precise

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:10.980
that you can draw with it. You
can write your name. It's

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:12.380
really
powerful, and we'll have a look

00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:13.480
at some of the things you can
do

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.859
with it in a sec.

00:42:15.859 --> 00:42:18.660
Now, what do
you do with a controller after

00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:22.960
you use it? You lose it! You
lose it. You lose it in the

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:25.540
couch or in your bag. We
didn't

00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:29.210
want that to happen. So the
controller has a home in the

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:30.960
headset. When you're done,

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:32.930
it
just sort of snuggles right in

00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:34.940
there, like this.

00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:37.740
And it's
details like these that we've

00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:38.950
worked hard to get

00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:44.920
right. These
little things that- - it's

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:48.940
very well built.
These little things that make

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:52.460
the whole experience easier and
more Let's talk about the last

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:53.460
seamless.

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:54.460
Let's talk about the last
problem.

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:56.290
Everything being kind of the
same.

00:42:56.290 --> 00:42:57.839
We wanted you to be able to
make

00:42:57.839 --> 00:42:58.839
it yours.

00:42:58.839 --> 00:43:03.130
And that starts with phones.
The Pixel phones are the first

00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:06.220
Daydream-ready phones, and the
headset of course works with

00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:08.480
them.
But there are a lot of other

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.030
Daydream-ready phones on the
way

00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:11.030
from our partners, too,

00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:12.829
A n d
the head set will work with

00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:16.140
them as well Another thing.
Things you wear.

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:17.140
Another thing. Things you wear

00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:18.920
don't come in one color. And we

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:22.550
didn't see why a VR headset
should either. With Daydream

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:25.300
View, you'll be able to choose
your color. At

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:28.410
launch we'll have
Slate. Later this year, we'll

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:36.920
add two other colors: Snow and
Crimson.

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:39.089
headset that you can make your
own.

00:43:39.089 --> 00:43:42.050
Now, of course, what really
matters here is what you can

00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:44.280
do.
There's a lot to show you, and

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.540
for that, I want to invite up

00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:47.400
A d
rienne McCallister, director

00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.400
of

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:53.560
Thanks Clay. Hi, I'm Adrienne.
partnerships.

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:57.970
Thanks Clay. Hi, I'm Adrienne.

00:43:57.970 --> 00:44:00.780
I lead VR partnerships for
Daydream.

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:02.980
The team has been working
closely with our partners to

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:04.589
bring some incredibly immersive

00:44:04.589 --> 00:44:07.849
experiences to Daydream. And,
I'd love to show you just a few

00:44:07.849 --> 00:44:12.100
of them. With Daydream you're
going to be able to Explore

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:15.540
some really
magical places. And what's

00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:16.950
more
magical than the Wizarding

00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:19.780
World
of JK Rowling?

00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:21.849
I'm excited to
announce that we've worked with

00:44:21.849 --> 00:44:24.410
Warner
Brothers to bring an exclusive

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:30.050
Fantastic Beasts experience to
Daydream.

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:41.200
( M u s ic)

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:54.550
magic wand that you can use to
levitate objects and cast

00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:58.420
spells.
We're really stoked about this…

00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:03.760
be wizards. We're also really
excited about some great

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:06.950
Educational
experiences on Daydream. One

00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:09.670
out-of-this-world example….

00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:12.550
makers of Star Chart…. an app
that let's you explore the

00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:16.390
solar
system and learn all the

00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:17.849
constellations.

00:45:17.849 --> 00:45:20.580
It's like having your own
personal planetarium where you

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:24.840
can fly thru the stars and
explore new galaxies.

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:28.390
The stars
are also a place for epic space

00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:31.150
battles… and Daydream is going
to be a stellar place for

00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:34.710
Games.
We're excited about GunJack2…

00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:40.960
from CCP… the creators of Eve.
In it, you're in the cockpit of

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:43.480
defending the fleet against
alien ships.

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:45.119
You can use the
controller look all around you,

00:45:45.119 --> 00:45:49.010
and aim the ship's laser
anywhere you want.T o blast

00:45:49.010 --> 00:45:51.300
those alien s hips.

00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:53.960
Back on
earth…. for when you

00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:56.589
just want to kick back on the
couch and watch something -

00:45:56.589 --> 00:46:02.329
we've been working with the
likes of Netflix, HBO, and Hulu

00:46:02.329 --> 00:46:03.670
Entertainment libraries to
Daydream.

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:07.481
When you're in VR, you can see
it all on your big screen, and

00:46:07.481 --> 00:46:12.450
take that big screen wherever
you want to go.

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:14.410
When you want to
turn your attention to current

00:46:14.410 --> 00:46:17.390
events and News, The New York
Times has been doing important

00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:20.450
work in VR documentary and
news.

00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:21.800
They've told us stories that
put

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:26.670
us alongside performers,
soldiers, and refugees. In VR

00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:29.430
you see the world from their
perspective.

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:38.329
It's powerful journalism...
brought into virtual reality.

00:46:38.329 --> 00:46:42.720
are bringing to Daydream. Over
50 partners are bringing you

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:45.640
apps and games to Daydream
before the end of the year, and

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:50.740
way.
To complement our partners….

00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:52.430
We're also bringing "The Best

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:56.609
of
Google" to Daydream. And

00:46:56.609 --> 00:46:57.930
there's so much here! First,
there's Google Play Movies...

00:46:57.930 --> 00:47:00.910
with the their library of shows
and films where you can watch

00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:04.250
on
your own big-screen. Then

00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:05.940
there's Google Photos, where
you

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:08.530
can relive your personal
memories in a completely

00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:14.370
immersive way. And then there's
Street View, and YouTube.

00:47:14.370 --> 00:47:17.690
Let's
take a look.

00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:20.570
With StreetView in Daydream,
you can visit thousands of

00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:24.150
places in 70 different
countries. And we've built 150

00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:32.230
curated tours of the world's
most amazing places, so you can

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:35.869
There are also some
hidden gems in Street View. For

00:47:35.869 --> 00:47:39.630
instance,
you can visit the Faroe Islands

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:43.920
of... a sheep.

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:46.200
Or as our Faroe
Island friends like to refer to

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:50.060
it... Sheep View.

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:53.470
And finally
there's… YouTube. YouTube on

00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:56.510
Daydream is amazing.

00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:59.240
To start…
You can access the entire

00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:03.010
library of YouTube videos -
regular videos - and watch them

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:06.579
on a cinema-sized screen. Your
favorites on YouTube have

00:48:06.579 --> 00:48:11.089
never... looked... better … or
bigger!

00:48:11.089 --> 00:48:14.920
experience
really shines is with 360 &amp; VR

00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:18.680
videos, where you're not just
watching a film, you're in the

00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:19.680
film.

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:23.350
from
the London Museum of Natural

00:48:23.350 --> 00:48:26.880
History. You're standing in the
hall of the museum, looking

00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:35.160
around and… dinosaurs come back
to life right in front of you.

00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:58.710
I
don't think he's done yet.

00:48:58.710 --> 00:49:11.050
He
looks even hungrier in virtual

00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:13.100
reality.

00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:15.650
of
thousands of immersive videos

00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:17.660
on
YouTube, and we're working with

00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:20.660
YouTube's top creators to bring
you even more original VR

00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:22.420
content in the months to come.

00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:25.510
So, that's just a glimpse of
what's coming to Daydream from

00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:29.280
our partners and from Google.
With that I'd like to turn it

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:34.040
back to Clay. Thank you.

00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:38.339
So,
that's the update onA p plause.

00:49:38.339 --> 00:49:40.410
So, that's the update on
Daydream. The first

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:43.040
Daydream-ready phones, with the

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:46.030
Pixel. A headset that's really
comfortable. A controller

00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:48.530
that's
powerful and also easy to use.

00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:51.300
And so much to experience.

00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:52.640
All
of this comes together in

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:54.450
November, when Daydream View
and

00:49:54.450 --> 00:49:57.040
the controller go on sale,
together, for $79.

00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:59.820
So that's it.
Our next step in pushing

00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:00.870
forward
the Daydream

00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:02.930
ecosystem, and our
next step in making high

00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:07.720
quality VR
accessible, to everyone. With

00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:12.330
that, I'd like to turn it over
to Mario. Thank you so much.

00:50:12.330 --> 00:50:18.069
(Applause).
Hello. I'm Mario. And I lead

00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:21.359
our product management group
within hardware. Let's talk

00:50:21.359 --> 00:50:26.160
now about the home. All of us
are connected in our homes,

00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:29.890
more and more through lots of
technology, and there's a lot

00:50:29.890 --> 00:50:33.900
of opportunity for improving
those experiences. Today we

00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:36.880
are announcing some exciting
products as part of our vision

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:40.599
for the home, including
connectivity, entertainment,

00:50:40.599 --> 00:50:41.970
and the Google

00:50:41.970 --> 00:50:43.210
A great online experience
Assistant.

00:50:43.210 --> 00:50:49.119
A great online experience
begins with great connectivity.

00:50:49.119 --> 00:50:52.681
routers were not designed for
the way we use WiFi at home

00:50:52.681 --> 00:50:55.859
today. We're streaming, gaming,

00:50:55.859 --> 00:51:01.630
video-chatting, and more,
throughout the entire house.

00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:08.280
OnHub router, with TP-Link and
ASUS as partners, to make home

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:12.760
connectivity better. We're
continuing to build this

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:15.590
technology for the benefit of
the partner ecosystem,

00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:18.980
including ISPs.
We've integrated the latest

00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:24.540
advances into our own Wi-Fi
product.

00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:30.849
to support the new ways we use
Wi-Fi.

00:51:30.849 --> 00:51:33.550
First, it's an expandable
system

00:51:33.550 --> 00:51:35.680
to give you much better
coverage.

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:39.079
Unlike a single central router,

00:51:39.079 --> 00:51:40.930
multiple Google Wifi points
work

00:51:40.930 --> 00:51:43.050
together to do a much better
job

00:51:43.050 --> 00:51:45.309
of delivering fast throughput
to

00:51:45.309 --> 00:51:47.380
every corner of the home.

00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:49.240
It's
modular, so you can get the

00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:54.050
right fit for your home's shape
and size. Simply add Wifi

00:51:54.050 --> 00:51:58.109
points to
expand coverage.

00:51:58.109 --> 00:51:59.589
We've also
designed the hardware to be

00:51:59.589 --> 00:52:02.930
visually subtle and fit in
anywhere in the home, without

00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:12.599
compromising aesthetics.

00:52:12.599 --> 00:52:16.160
actively manage and optimize
your network, behind the

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:18.380
scenes,
so you don't have to figure out

00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:21.680
how to adjust your router.
Network Assist keeps your

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:23.930
signal
strong, even as you roam

00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:29.839
throughout the house, by
intelligently transitioning you

00:52:29.839 --> 00:52:34.309
placing you on the right Wi-Fi
channel to avoid congestion.

00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:35.760
For
those times when you do want

00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:39.579
control of your Wi-Fi network,
we make it easy through a

00:52:39.579 --> 00:52:40.579
companion app.

00:52:40.579 --> 00:52:45.380
At my house, it's sometimes
hard to get my teenage

00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:48.319
daughters
to pause YouTube or Netflix on

00:52:48.319 --> 00:52:52.780
their computers to come to the
dinner table. Google Wifi lets

00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:53.780
you manage the

00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:57.460
W i - F i access
of the your kids. If dinner is

00:52:57.460 --> 00:52:59.290
on the fable, you don't have to

00:52:59.290 --> 00:53:02.819
shut down the router. Just go
to the app and simply press

00:53:02.819 --> 00:53:08.400
pause on their devices for
quality family t ime.

00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:10.990
Google
Wifi will be available

00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:15.600
for pre-orders in November and
it will ship in early December.

00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:20.810
$129
for a single-pack. For larger

00:53:20.810 --> 00:53:21.810
homes, we are

00:53:21.810 --> 00:53:26.390
offering a 3-pack
at $299 We believe Google Wifi

00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:28.609
will
make a big and immediate

00:53:28.609 --> 00:53:33.609
improvement in internet
connectivity in your home.

00:53:33.609 --> 00:53:35.180
Our
second product announcement

00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:37.170
today as part of our vision for

00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:39.810
the home is in the area of
entertainment. We have some

00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:43.290
exciting news about Chromecast.

00:53:43.290 --> 00:53:47.130
Last year, we launched two new
Chromecast products: the

00:53:47.130 --> 00:53:48.970
second-generation Chromecast
and

00:53:48.970 --> 00:53:53.559
Chromecast Audio. The feedback
has been very positive. Overall

00:53:53.559 --> 00:53:58.090
watch time has increased 160%
since last year.

00:53:58.090 --> 00:54:01.400
We've now sold
more than 30M Chromecast

00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:03.350
devices, and we're continuing
to

00:54:03.350 --> 00:54:06.700
innovate on Chromecast to
deliver the best streaming

00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:12.680
experience.
So, today we are introducing

00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:16.420
premium TV streaming device to
date. Chromecast Ultra brings

00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:20.180
everything you already love
about Chromecast plus even

00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:24.960
crisper picture and better
performance.

00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:33.580
your favorite content in up to
4K Ultra HD resolution with HDR

00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:37.059
can get the highest contrast
ratio and deepest colors from

00:54:37.059 --> 00:54:39.910
your favorite TV shows on
Netflix

00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:44.180
mine happens to be Narcos,
popular titles from Vudu and

00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:46.880
YouTube's extensive catalogue
of

00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:48.250
4K videos.

00:54:48.250 --> 00:54:50.940
And we're happy to announce
that Google Play Movies will be

00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:57.250
November, supported on
Chromecast Ultra. Your shows

00:54:57.250 --> 00:55:01.960
and
movies will look fantastic.

00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:04.799
improved performance and
reliability.

00:55:04.799 --> 00:55:08.680
Chromecast Ultra is 1.8 times
faster to load content and

00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:10.990
includes major WiFi
improvements

00:55:10.990 --> 00:55:18.990
to support streams from full HD
to Ultra HD without a hitch.

00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:21.520
with an Ethernet port. It's
integrated into the power

00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:26.010
adapter so it's simple to
connect.

00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:29.400
Chromecast
Ultra comes in a small, compact

00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:32.420
size, that hides conveniently
behind your TV. No extra

00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:35.430
cables,
boxes, or clutter. And of

00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:39.069
course, Chromecast Ultra
includes all of the great

00:55:39.069 --> 00:55:41.410
content already available on
Chromecast.

00:55:41.410 --> 00:55:43.510
J u s
t cast your favorite

00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:48.340
entertainment from your phone,
tablet or lab top. Chromecast

00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:49.340
Ultra will be

00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:50.700
Chromecast Ultra will be
available later this year for

00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:54.680
$69. It showcases the next
generation streaming

00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:56.849
technology.

00:55:56.849 --> 00:56:02.290
Home.
At Google I/O, we gave a

00:56:02.290 --> 00:56:04.490
preview
of where we plan on taking

00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:08.869
Google Home in the next few
years. Today, we're sharing the

00:56:08.869 --> 00:56:13.270
details of the product. As we
heard from Sundar, the Google

00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:16.540
Assistant works across many
facets of your life, including

00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:17.920
at Home.

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:20.290
Our homes are special and
different from other

00:56:20.290 --> 00:56:22.280
environments. It's where we
spend time with family and

00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:25.609
friends, where we get a lot of
stuff done, and where we relax

00:56:25.609 --> 00:56:27.630
and unwind.

00:56:27.630 --> 00:56:30.700
Many times, you
can't or don't want to reach

00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:32.820
for
your phone -- you may be

00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:33.870
cooking, doing homework with
the

00:56:33.870 --> 00:56:36.839
kids, or sitting with friends
at the

00:56:36.839 --> 00:56:39.010
dinner table. So, we've
designed

00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:42.069
a product that works in a
hands-free way and makes the

00:56:42.069 --> 00:56:44.090
Assistant
available whenever you need it

00:56:44.090 --> 00:56:50.921
voice.
Google Home lets you Enjoy your

00:56:50.921 --> 00:56:54.620
music
Get answers from Google Manage

00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:55.620
your everyday

00:56:55.620 --> 00:57:01.200
Manage your
everyday tasks and home. So

00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:02.730
here
is Google Home.

00:57:02.730 --> 00:57:05.280
Our design was
inspired by consumer products

00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:08.559
that are commonly found in
homes, like wine glasses and

00:57:08.559 --> 00:57:12.880
candles. We went with a white
top and a clean diagonal face

00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:15.319
for a neutral look that blends
in.

00:57:15.319 --> 00:57:19.059
The top surface has LEDs that
provide visual feedback when

00:57:19.059 --> 00:57:23.500
Google Home recognizes "OK
Google", so you know when it is

00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:24.500
t
ening.

00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:27.440
In those rare moments when
voice won't do, the top surface

00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:32.750
panel. You can simply use your
finger to pause the music,

00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:34.970
adjust volume, or trigger the

00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:36.450
G o o g l e
Google Home was designed with

00:57:36.450 --> 00:57:37.450
a
Assistant.

00:57:37.450 --> 00:57:38.450
Google Home was designed with a

00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:39.810
2-microphone system for
accurate

00:57:39.810 --> 00:57:43.440
far-field voice recognition.
We've simulated hundreds of

00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:47.110
thousands of noisy environments
and applied machine learning to

00:57:47.110 --> 00:57:48.750
recognize
patterns that allow us to

00:57:48.750 --> 00:57:52.339
filter
and separate speech from noise.

00:57:52.339 --> 00:57:55.970
This enables us to deliver
best-in-class voice recognition

00:57:55.970 --> 00:57:57.790
and minimize error rates --
even

00:57:57.790 --> 00:57:58.790
from across the

00:57:58.790 --> 00:58:00.299
The mic mute
button gives youR o o m .

00:58:00.299 --> 00:58:08.559
The mic mute button gives you
total control so the product is

00:58:08.559 --> 00:58:11.150
speaker in Google Home sets the
standard for audio quality in

00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:13.770
this new category. It contains
a

00:58:13.770 --> 00:58:17.660
forward facing high-excursion
active driver, with dual

00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:20.770
side-facing passive radiators.
This design delivers a

00:58:20.770 --> 00:58:25.170
full-range, natural sounding
experience, with rich bass and

00:58:25.170 --> 00:58:27.482
C l e a r
Finally, we made it reallyh i

00:58:27.482 --> 00:58:28.482
g
hs.

00:58:28.482 --> 00:58:29.482
Finally, we made it really
simple to swap bases to

00:58:29.482 --> 00:58:35.099
customize your Google Home
device to match the style of

00:58:35.099 --> 00:58:37.310
All
of these features add up to a

00:58:37.310 --> 00:58:39.299
beautiful and powerful

00:58:39.299 --> 00:58:41.020
So now
I'm going to inviteP r oduct.

00:58:41.020 --> 00:58:43.390
So now I'm going to invite
Rishi Chandra on stage to show

00:58:43.390 --> 00:58:45.381
in more detail what Google Home

00:58:45.381 --> 00:58:49.299
can do.

00:58:49.299 --> 00:58:55.150
Thanks Mario. I'm
excited to show you Google

00:58:55.150 --> 00:58:57.480
Home.
It's a little hard to replicate

00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:59.730
a home environment on the
stage,

00:58:59.730 --> 00:59:01.940
so we recorded real examples of

00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:04.450
Google Home in action.
Afterwards, you will have a

00:59:04.450 --> 00:59:07.180
chance to experience it live in

00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:11.619
the demo stations upstairs. So
let's get started. First,

00:59:11.619 --> 00:59:13.420
Google
Home helps you enjoy your

00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:14.420
music.

00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:16.670
W
hen I get home, I love to

00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:19.881
kickback, relax and listen to
some tunes and voice is a

00:59:19.881 --> 00:59:22.160
really simple way to get "OK
Google, play Don't Let me

00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:24.960
started.
"OK Google, play Don't Let me

00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:26.280
Down by the Chainsmokers"

00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:32.609
D on't
let me down by the chain s

00:59:32.609 --> 00:59:40.190
mokers. Sure. Playing on

00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:45.400
It's
really simple. And you're

00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:46.579
YouTube.
It's really simple. And you're

00:59:46.579 --> 00:59:51.780
with your voice. "OK Google,
turn it down"

00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:53.010
And the great
thing is that you never a need

00:59:53.010 --> 00:59:54.160
to pull out your phone or
fumble

00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:57.290
with a remote. Just ask for
your favorite

00:59:57.290 --> 00:59:59.619
song, artist or album and we
can

00:59:59.619 --> 01:00:02.220
play it. In this case, I'm
using YouTube

01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:06.089
Music, which has an almost

01:00:06.089 --> 01:00:11.130
concerts, covers and more.
Google Home supports many of

01:00:11.130 --> 01:00:12.329
the
most popular music services,

01:00:12.329 --> 01:00:15.650
including Google Play Music,
Spotify, Pandora,

01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:18.560
TuneIn, and
soon iHeartRadio, so you have a

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:21.049
wide selection of options.

01:00:21.049 --> 01:00:22.049
For
example, let's say I'm in the

01:00:22.049 --> 01:00:26.700
mood for some retro workout
music. Google Play Music has a

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:29.581
ton of great expert-curated
playlists that can match any

01:00:29.581 --> 01:00:31.589
mood or activity.

01:00:31.589 --> 01:00:35.059
OK Google,
play 80s workout music from

01:00:35.059 --> 01:00:36.059
Google Play

01:00:36.059 --> 01:00:39.599
M usic. All right.
Here is a Google Play Music

01:00:39.599 --> 01:00:44.790
station called head bands and
leg warmers, 80's workout. (

01:00:44.790 --> 01:00:50.710
This song brings back someMusic)

01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:53.119
This song brings back some
great memories.

01:00:53.119 --> 01:00:56.380
We also make it
easy to set a default music

01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:59.500
service. So if your preferred
provider is Spotify, you don't

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:01.490
have to keep saying "on
Spotify"

01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:04.830
over and over. We want Google
Home to adapt to your

01:01:04.830 --> 01:01:07.530
preferences.
And what's unique about Google

01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:09.069
Home is that our music search

01:01:09.069 --> 01:01:11.160
is
powered by Google. So if you

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:12.430
don't remember the exact name
of

01:01:12.430 --> 01:01:16.530
that song, we can still help
you. Check this out.

01:01:16.530 --> 01:01:18.901
OK Google,
play that Shakira song from

01:01:18.901 --> 01:01:19.901
Zootopia

01:01:19.901 --> 01:01:24.651
(
It's pretty cool. Even though I

01:01:24.651 --> 01:01:35.650
Music)
It's pretty cool. Even though I

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:37.211
to
infer it from the context of

01:01:37.211 --> 01:01:39.640
the
movie Zootopia. This comes from

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:42.470
years of building search. So
now

01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:45.579
it is easier than ever to play
the music you want on Google

01:01:45.579 --> 01:01:46.579
Home.

01:01:46.579 --> 01:01:48.680
listen to all types of audio --

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:53.619
whether it be music, news,
podcasts and more. So if you

01:01:53.619 --> 01:01:54.799
want to listen to your favorite

01:01:54.799 --> 01:02:01.170
the latest news from the NPR,
you can just ask for it. And of

01:02:01.170 --> 01:02:05.299
course, you can also cast audio
to Google Home from your

01:02:05.299 --> 01:02:10.540
Android
or iOS device, so you can play

01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:14.530
almost anything on the speaker.

01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:18.569
our
great sounding Wifi speaker

01:02:18.569 --> 01:02:20.240
with
voice control from the Google

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:21.240
Assistant.

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:24.010
.
S o that's music. Number

01:02:24.010 --> 01:02:28.300
two, Google home helps you get
answers from Our mission has

01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:30.619
always been toGoogle.
Our mission has always been to

01:02:30.619 --> 01:02:32.770
information. Over the past few
years, we have gone beyond the

01:02:32.770 --> 01:02:34.630
blue links into providing
direct

01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:36.819
answers to your questions. We
do

01:02:36.819 --> 01:02:39.069
this with the Knowledge Graph,
which as Sundar mentions,

01:02:39.069 --> 01:02:41.700
understands
over 70B facts.

01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:44.280
With Google
Home, we give you a way to

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:48.830
access the knowledge of Google
in a hands-free way. For

01:02:48.830 --> 01:02:52.630
example, let's stay with the
music theme. OK Google, what is

01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:53.630
Adele's real name?

01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:57.309
A delle's full
name is Adelle Lori blue at

01:02:57.309 --> 01:02:59.040
OK
Google, how many Grammy'skins.

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:02.900
OK Google, how many Grammy's
has she won?A ccording to

01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:09.349
Wikipedia with a total of 20
awards. She is the most

01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:13.150
nominated woman in Grammy
history. That's a lot of You

01:03:13.150 --> 01:03:14.180
may have noticed that last
Grammy's.

01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:15.200
You may have noticed that last

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:19.470
answer didn't come Google, but
instead from Wikipedia. Our

01:03:19.470 --> 01:03:20.940
knowledge graph can cover a lot

01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:24.710
of information, but it doesn't
cover everything. Fortunately,

01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:26.860
we launched a feature several
years ago called Featured

01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:30.859
Snippets. If we cannot find a
direct answer, we try to find

01:03:30.859 --> 01:03:32.349
the website that has best
answer

01:03:32.349 --> 01:03:34.230
to your question, and give you
a short

01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:36.339
quote from it to help you
decide

01:03:36.339 --> 01:03:40.789
whether to read more. It allows
you to find answers to a much

01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:44.319
wider range of questions. So
for example,

01:03:44.319 --> 01:03:47.060
let's say I want to confirm
before the kids spoil the dog

01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:48.079
with treats.

01:03:48.079 --> 01:03:50.650
OK Google, can dogs eat
chocolate?A

01:03:50.650 --> 01:03:54.730
ccording to hill's pet
nutrition, humans met tap lies

01:03:54.730 --> 01:03:58.750
the A brvment omine but dogs
process is much more So that

01:03:58.750 --> 01:04:02.539
sounds like a clear no.slowly.

01:04:02.539 --> 01:04:04.859
So that sounds like a clear no.

01:04:04.859 --> 01:04:08.460
Or let's say I accidentally
spill my wine. OK Google, how

01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:10.150
do
you get wine stains out of a

01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:12.869
rug?A
ccording to patch, mix one

01:04:12.869 --> 01:04:15.549
quarter tea spoon of liquid
dish washing deearthent with

01:04:15.549 --> 01:04:19.290
four cups of lukewarm water.
Work the solution into the

01:04:19.290 --> 01:04:25.000
stain by using a gentle
blotting motion. Then use

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.680
water and a clean cloth to blot

01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:30.079
the spill and it should remove
the rest of the stain. We are

01:04:30.079 --> 01:04:31.079
very

01:04:31.079 --> 01:04:32.890
This is something only Google
thorough.

01:04:32.890 --> 01:04:37.789
This is something only Google
can do, and we are constantly

01:04:37.789 --> 01:04:39.799
improving it. And as search
gets

01:04:39.799 --> 01:04:45.359
better, Google Home also gets
better.

01:04:45.359 --> 01:04:49.049
understanding of local and
traffic information, so now you

01:04:49.049 --> 01:04:52.369
and schedule. So let's say I'm
planning a backpacking trip to

01:04:52.369 --> 01:04:54.640
Costa Rica and I need to get
some camping gear.

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:57.329
W e l l, I can
ask Google home for some OK

01:04:57.329 --> 01:04:58.569
Google, what are some nearby
help.

01:04:58.569 --> 01:04:59.660
OK Google, what are some nearby

01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:05.089
camping stores? I found a few
places within 8.6 miles. The

01:05:05.089 --> 01:05:08.000
first run is the north face on
post street in San Francisco.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.450
The second one is Marmud on
post street in San Francisco.

01:05:11.450 --> 01:05:15.050
The third one is REI other than
Brandon street in San OK

01:05:15.050 --> 01:05:18.000
Google, how's the trafficF
rancisco.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:25.000
OK Google, how's the traffic
looking

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
to REI?

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:33.569
OK Google, how
long will it take to bike

01:05:33.569 --> 01:05:34.569
there?

01:05:34.569 --> 01:05:36.190
B
iking to R EI will take you 24

01:05:36.190 --> 01:05:37.950
minutes. I think I will bike

01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:40.300
This is all built on years of
there.

01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:44.039
This is all built on years of
investment in Google Maps. And

01:05:44.039 --> 01:05:45.170
over time, we will make it easy

01:05:45.170 --> 01:05:46.371
to send the directions right to

01:05:46.371 --> 01:05:47.480
your phone so you can just pick

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:51.450
up where you left off. And of
course, Google can teach me the

01:05:51.450 --> 01:05:53.780
most important thing as I
prepare for my trip to Costa

01:05:53.780 --> 01:05:56.940
Rica.
OK Google, how do I say I would

01:05:56.940 --> 01:06:07.650
lot and I'm not sure I can say
it the same way. Your Google

01:06:07.650 --> 01:06:10.609
Assistant is there to help you
when you need it. Finally, you

01:06:10.609 --> 01:06:11.609
have an assistant that can
bring

01:06:11.609 --> 01:06:13.320
the knowledge of Google, just
by

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:15.130
asking for it.

01:06:15.130 --> 01:06:17.869
Third, Google
Home helps you manage everyday

01:06:17.869 --> 01:06:21.360
tasks.
Home is where we love to relax,

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:23.760
done. We want Google Home to be

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:24.760
able to help you stay on top of

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:26.559
your busy schedule.

01:06:26.559 --> 01:06:28.339
So we
designed a feature called "My

01:06:28.339 --> 01:06:30.530
Day" that, with your
permission, summarizes

01:06:30.530 --> 01:06:32.369
important topics and activities

01:06:32.369 --> 01:06:36.290
for you in a simple way. It's
great to try with your morning

01:06:36.290 --> 01:06:37.290
coffee.

Home also excels at assisting
you with common tasks in the

01:07:18.059 --> 01:07:19.859
home. For example, when
planning

01:07:19.859 --> 01:07:22.829
your dinner, you can easily add
things to your shopping lists,

01:07:22.829 --> 01:07:25.480
get nutrition information on
ingredients, and set up

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:27.770
multiple
timers to manage your cooking

01:07:27.770 --> 01:07:31.450
times. All with your voice. OK
Google, can you add kids

01:07:31.450 --> 01:07:32.990
vitamins to my shopping list?

01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:35.160
O k

everyday
tasks goes beyond just the

01:07:56.250 --> 01:07:59.730
kitchen. We want to help you in
all aspect of your home life.

01:07:59.730 --> 01:08:02.710
For example, Google Home can
even be the ultimate arbitrator

01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:04.750
between those family debates.
OK

01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:07.740
Google, flip a coin?

01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:10.900
Okay. It's

01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:15.490
tails.
We want to go beyond what only

01:08:15.490 --> 01:08:16.490
use your voice to also interact

01:08:16.490 --> 01:08:19.411
with your favorite apps and
services. We'll have more to

01:08:19.411 --> 01:08:22.429
share about how partners can
integrate with the Google

01:08:22.429 --> 01:08:24.890
Assistant later today.

01:08:24.890 --> 01:08:27.520
Four,
Google Home helps you control

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.509
devices at home.

01:08:29.509 --> 01:08:31.520
As homes get
more connected, we think voice

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:35.561
is going to be standard way to
control your home devices. It's

01:08:35.561 --> 01:08:39.880
just really easy. So for those
with smart home devices, we

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:41.400
have
partnered with Nest,

01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:43.240
SmartThings, Philips Hue,

and

01:08:45.390 --> 01:08:48.799
lights, switches, and
thermostats. You can control

01:08:48.799 --> 01:08:52.759
individual devices, rooms, or
your entire home. And we will

01:08:52.759 --> 01:08:53.759
be
constantly adding more device

01:08:53.759 --> 01:08:56.310
partners over time.

01:08:56.310 --> 01:08:58.460
We want to
support as many smart home

01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:01.940
devices as possible.
Fortunately, if you are one of

01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:04.080
the 30M people who have
purchased a Chromecast or

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:08.009
Chromecast Audio, you can now
use Google Home to control your
